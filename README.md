# Twig Coding Challenge

## Introduction

The objective of the Twig Coding Challenge was to divide an array into N equally sized sub arrays.

A suite of unit tests were written to test the basic algorithm and explore any edge cases.

## Install

`npm install`

## Tests

`npm run test`

## Development Environment

The source code was written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and the compiled Javascript
was tested using the [Mocha Test Framework](https://mochajs.org/) and the [Chai Assertion Library](https://www.chaijs.com/).

The node module [esm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esm) was used to allow Node 6+ to load ECMAScript modules.

The code was formatted and linted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
